## Tightly integrated into the Gnome Shell experience

In Gnome Shell, the *Dash* indicates currently running applications and acts as an optional quick launch and favourites facility. By default the Dash is accessible only inside the *Overview*. This extension **enhances the dash** moving it out of the overview and **transforming it in a dock** for an **easier launching** of applications and a **faster switching** between windows and desktops without having to leave the desktop view.

## Feature-rich dock

Dash to dock supports **intellihide** and **autohide** modes, as well as a fixed mode. Quickly **Switch workspace** by scrolling over the dock. **Cycle between windows** of each application by clicking on its launcher. Additional **indicators** show the number of **open windows**.The extension supports **multi-monitor** configurations, **rtl languages**, **accessibility** via Ctrl-Alt-Tab shortcut, **localization** and it is **theme-friendly** (learn more about <a href="https://github.com/micheleg/dash-to-dock#theming">theming</a> support).

## Customizable

Customize the **dash and icon size**, showing or hiding **favourites and running applications**. Choose the default **action when clicking** on a running application launcher: **minimize current window**, or **launch new window**. Optional **minimize windows on Shift+click** (Shift + double click to minimize all the windows of the application. Explore the <a href="https://github.com/micheleg/dash-to-dock#settings"> extension settings</a> for a comprehesive overview of possible customizations.
