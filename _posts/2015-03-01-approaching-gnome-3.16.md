With the release of GNOME 3.16 [approaching](https://wiki.gnome.org/ThreePointFifteen),
I had the time to test the extension with the upstream development code. Everything seems
to be in good shape for a painless transition to GNOME 3.16 without delays.

As you can see the extension is already running well in GNOME 3.15.90. You can test it by
yourself from the [experimental branch](https://github.com/micheleg/dash-to-dock/tree/experimental_gnome-3.16)
on Github. As always, if you spot any bug, please [file a bug report]({{ site.github_project_url }}/issues).

The extension benefits from the most evident visual change of GNOME Shell 3.16, i.e. the removal of the
bottom message tray. Thanks to the
[new notifications](http://blogs.gnome.org/aday/2015/02/26/in-case-you-didnt-notice/) design &#8212;
notifications are now integrated into the calendar menu &#8212; the bottom placed dock doesn't
interfere anymore with any shell element and feel more integrated with the rest of the UI.

The running dots appearance was updated according to the new style, while I'm still thinking if keeping
the grey background as in the new theme or reverting to a darker color as in the top panel.

Overall it seems that GNOME 3.16 is promising for Dash to Dock too.
