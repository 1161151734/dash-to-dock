The most notable feature introduced in this release, thanks to the work of [Franglais125](https://github.com/franglais125) and inspired by the [dash-to-panel project](https://github.com/jderose9/dash-to-panel), is an optional popupmenu showing the thumbnails preview of the open windows.

Windows thumbnails were already available inside the default launcher menu (right click menu), but a new dedicated popup menu more easily accessible has been now introduced.

The thumnbails menu can be associated to any of the available click options (but not to the mouseover yet).

Additionally, when using multi-monitor docks, it is now possible to show only the applications of each individual monitor (_isolate monitor_ option).
Further fixes and translations updates, are listed in the release notes below.

As usual, the extension can be obtained from the [extension website](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/), or downloaded manually from the [release page]({{ site.release_page_url }}). See the [alternative installation methods]({{ relative }}/download.html) for instructions.
