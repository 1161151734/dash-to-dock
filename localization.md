## Localization
Localization is supported via *gettext*. The translatable strings are contained in the file <code>./po/dashtodock.pot</code> that is generated by the command:
<pre>
make potfile
</pre>
This file can be used to generate the po translation file for a specific language either with <code>msginit</code> or with a GUI tool such as *poedit* or *Gtranslator*.

Po files for already translated languages are found in the po directory. When the translatable strings change the command
<pre>
make mergepo
</pre>
can be used to update all po files before updating translations.

If you want to contribute, just send me the updated or new po file for your language. You can get in touch with me with a bug report either on github or on the extension site or even directly by mail.
