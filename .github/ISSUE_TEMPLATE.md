Hi,

Thanks for filing a bug report.

In order to help addressing the issue, please provide a description of the steps to reproduce the bug, and include the following information if relevant:

* Gnome Shell version and Dash to Dock version (you can get it from the about panel in the extension settings),
* Whether you are running on X or Wayland.
* Whether you have a multi-monitor configuration.
* The extension settings: you can get them with the command ```dconf dump /org/gnome/shell/extensions/dash-to-dock/```.

Moreover, please check if the bug persists disabling all other extensions and if the bug affect the default dash, i.e. disabling Dash to Dock.

Thank you for your collaboration.
